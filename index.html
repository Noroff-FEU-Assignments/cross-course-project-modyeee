      ZasdYou would require a specific “lock” to secure you from uninvited guests. In this topic I will try to give some advice on how you protect yourself. One of the first things you might to consider is to install an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. An SSL certificate is a must-have if you run an ecommerce store or collect visitor information, like emails, on your site. In addition to boosting SEO, SSL certificates prove that any data your visitors send to your site is using an encrypted channel, so hackers can’t see it while it’s in transit. Also consider using Anti-Malware software. In most cases it can be provided by the hosting service that will help to secure your website and they might have a good protection plan consisting of SSL, Hack protection, Automatic backups, DDoS protection. These are the security basics for your site, and the features you should look for whenever you’re looking at picking a hosting provider. Whether your provider comes with tools built-in, or offers extra freebies such as SiteLock, anti-malware software gives you a welcome extra layer of protection. And of course encourage your customers to create strong , reliable passwords. It will certainly help to secure your website even better. Don't forget to keep your website updated with the leading software which will help you to prevent hacking.
